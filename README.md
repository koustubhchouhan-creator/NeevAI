# NeevAI – AI-Powered Infrastructure Decision Intelligence Platform

NeevAI is an AI-powered infrastructure project monitoring and decision-intelligence platform developed for **Smart India Hackathon 2026 – Problem Statement SIH26103**.

> **Core idea:** Predict → Explain → Compare → Prioritise → Recommend

## Problem

Infrastructure projects can suffer from schedule delays, cost overruns, slow physical progress, low financial utilisation, repeated revisions, and implementation bottlenecks. NeevAI is designed to move monitoring from reactive reporting toward predictive and proactive decision support.

## Current Status

### Implemented / Built

- React + TypeScript project dashboard
- Dashboard layout and overview
- Project listing and search/filtering
- Project analytics integration
- Add Project form
- Edit Project form
- Project Details view
- Predictions and risk-ranking view
- Loading and error states
- Dashboard refresh
- Shared TypeScript types
- Service-based API integration
- Node.js + TypeScript + Express backend foundation
- MongoDB + Mongoose data architecture
- Project, snapshot, outcome and import-log model structure
- Validation and CSV data-import architecture
- Source-traceable project data structure
- Analytics/risk service foundation

The current Projects interface loads dashboard analytics, supports project search, opens project details, and provides add/edit workflows. The dashboard provides total, ongoing, delayed and completed project summaries.

## Solution

NeevAI acts as an intelligence layer over infrastructure project-monitoring data. It combines project master information, periodic snapshots, historical performance, financial/physical progress and schedule information.

The intended intelligence pipeline is:

## Data Architecture

### Project Master

Stores stable information such as:

- Project ID
- Project Name
- Domain / Sector
- Project Type
- Ministry / Department
- Implementing Agency
- State / Location
- Original Cost
- Original Completion Date
- Data Source

### Project Snapshots

Each reporting period is preserved as a separate record:

- Project ID
- Report Type
- Report Period
- Report Date
- Original Cost
- Revised Cost
- Anticipated Cost
- Cumulative Expenditure
- Physical Progress
- Project Status
- Remarks
- Source Report
- Source Page

### Project Outcomes

Designed to store final project information such as final status, final cost, final schedule, risk level and summary.

### Import Logging

The backend includes an `ImportLog` model for tracking import type, source file, total/valid/imported/skipped/failed records, status, timestamps and errors.

## Analytics

The analytics layer is designed to calculate:

- Cost change
- Cost overrun percentage
- Expenditure percentage
- Schedule delay
- Completion-date shift
- Progress velocity
- Progress slowdown
- Financial progress
- Cost variance
- Schedule variance
- Actual vs expected velocity
- Cost risk
- Velocity risk
- Efficiency risk
- Overall project risk

## Risk Intelligence

The proposed risk framework combines multiple signals:

```text
Overall Risk Score =
40% Schedule Risk
+ 30% Cost Risk
+ 20% Progress Risk
+ 10% Historical Risk
```

The weights are intended to be configurable and validated rather than treated as permanent constants.

## Early Warning Engine

Examples of intended rules:

```text
Delay Probability > 80%
        ↓
Critical Schedule Alert
```

```text
Cost Overrun Probability > 75%
        ↓
High Cost Risk Alert
```

```text
Physical Progress Gap > Threshold
        ↓
Progress Deviation Alert
```

The engine can combine ML predictions, statistical anomalies, business rules and historical thresholds.

## Explainable AI

NeevAI is designed to explain predictions rather than behave as a black box.

Potential outputs:

- Global feature importance
- Project-specific risk drivers
- Cost escalation factors
- Delay risk factors

**SHAP** is planned for model explainability.

## Project Intelligence Assistant

An advanced LLM assistant is planned to provide natural-language access to verified project intelligence.

Example questions:

- Which projects have the highest delay risk?
- Why is a project considered high risk?
- Which sector has the highest cost escalation risk?
- How does a project compare with similar projects?
- Which projects require immediate intervention?

The LLM should not independently generate predictions. The intended flow is:

```text
User Query
    ↓
LLM Understanding
    ↓
Database / Analytics / ML Query
    ↓
Verified Results
    ↓
Natural Language Explanation
```

## ML Strategy

Potential targets:

- Cost overrun percentage / yes-no
- Time overrun days / yes-no
- Overall implementation risk

Potential features:

- Expenditure ratio
- Financial progress gap
- Cost revision count
- Spending velocity
- Time elapsed ratio
- Schedule progress gap
- Extension history
- Physical progress
- Financial progress
- Progress velocity
- Reporting consistency
- Sector
- Location
- Project size
- Implementing agency

Models being considered:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- LightGBM

Evaluation metrics include Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, MAE, RMSE and R² as appropriate.

## Data Import

The backend import architecture is organised around:

```text
backend/
├── data/
│   ├── templates/
│   ├── imports/
│   │   ├── projects/
│   │   ├── snapshots/
│   │   └── outcomes/
│   ├── processed/
│   └── errors/
├── src/
│   ├── constants/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── validators/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── routes/
│   └── utils/
└── scripts/
```

Important data rules:

- Do not invent missing source data.
- Keep official project IDs as text.
- Store costs in INR crore.
- Store percentages numerically.
- Preserve reporting periods.
- Keep historical snapshots instead of overwriting them.
- Maintain source-report traceability.
- Prefer official project IDs for project matching.

## Running Locally

### Backend

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the API (falls back to an in-memory MongoDB when MONGODB_URI is unset)
npm run dev
```

The API is served at `http://localhost:5000/api/v1`. Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` to set the port, provide a real `MONGODB_URI`, or configure `CORS_ORIGIN`.

### Frontend

```bash
# Move into the frontend package
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server (proxies /api requests to the backend)
npm run dev
```

The app is served at `http://localhost:5173`. Copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env` only if the API base URL differs from the default.

> Note: The frontend reads and writes all data through the backend REST API. The legacy Firebase module is retained but unused.

## Development Note

NeevAI is an evolving prototype. The dashboard and project-management foundation are implemented, while the complete predictive AI/ML, explainability, early-warning and LLM layers are being developed incrementally. This README intentionally separates implemented functionality from advanced planned capabilities.
